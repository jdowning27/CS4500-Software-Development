- a signature/purpose statement of functionality that creates states 
   - [Constructor signature and purpose for State](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/8393dcabbab10654a58c728144d4f2f0b012461e/Fish/Common/State.py#L18)
- unit tests for functionality of taking a turn 
   - [Line 102 to 120 in state_test.py](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/8393dcabbab10654a58c728144d4f2f0b012461e/Fish/Common/Test/state_test.py#L102)
- unit tests for functionality of placing an avatar 
   - [Line 24 to 42 in state_test.py](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/8393dcabbab10654a58c728144d4f2f0b012461e/Fish/Common/Test/state_test.py#L24)
- unit tests for functionality of final-state test
   - [Line 122 to 135 in state_test.py](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/8393dcabbab10654a58c728144d4f2f0b012461e/Fish/Common/Test/state_test.py#L122)

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "8393dcabbab10654a58c728144d4f2f0b012461e".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:
    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/tree/8393dcabbab10654a58c728144d4f2f0b012461e/Fish>

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
