## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 9

You must make an appointment with your grader during his or her office
hour to demo your project. See the end of the self-eval for the assigned
grader. 

Indicate below where your TA can find the following elements in your strategy 
and/or player-interface modules: 

1. for human players, point the TA to
   - the interface (signature) that an AI player implements
   - the interface that the human-GUI component implements
   - the implementation of the player GUI

2. for game observers, point the TA to
   - the `game-observer` interface that observers implement 
   - the point where the `referee` consumes observers 
   - the callback from `referee` to observers concerning turns

3. for tournament observers, point the TA to
   - the `tournament-observer` interface that observers implement 
   - the point where the `manager` consumes observers 
   - the callback to observes concerning the results of rounds 


Do not forget to meet the assigned TA for a demo; see bottom.  If the
TA's office hour overlaps with other obligations, sign up for a 1-1.
