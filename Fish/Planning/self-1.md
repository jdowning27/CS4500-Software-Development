## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?

    - [Player Interface in system.pdf](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/master/Fish/Planning/system.pdf)
    @ second subsection > Player Interface > first bullet
  

  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games
    - [Referee in system.pdf](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/master/Fish/Planning/system.pdf)
  @ first subsection > Referee


  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping players into games and dispatching to referee components
    - [Player Interface in system.pdf](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/master/Fish/Planning/system.pdf)
    @ second subsection > Player Interface > second bullet


- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
    - [#2 & #4 in milestones.pdf](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/master/Fish/Planning/milestones.pdf)


  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 
    - [#2 & #6 in milestones.pdf](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/master/Fish/Planning/milestones.pdf)



  - for running remote tournaments on a network
    - [#6 in milestones.pdf](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/anton/blob/master/Fish/Planning/milestones.pdf)



- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?
    - In system.pdf, we start the memo with a brief description of the game, and list the essential game rules. In order to not overwhelm readers, the software components in system.pdf and steps in milestone.pdf are in bulleted lists.



  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?
    - Each sentence in both memos have a purpose, and are short to improve readability



  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?
    - A variety of sentences structures are used in the English part of our memos, but in general we try to use consistent language to describe software components




  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?
    - The sentences are complete. However, some details in our bulleted lists are not, and this was a conscious decision we made when describing components.



  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)
    - There are no spelling or grammar mistakes



The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
